## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/photo_square.jpg" alt="profile picture">}}

I am a PhD candidate of geophysics at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I study Seismology.
My work focuses on earthquake detection to swiftly analyze years of data and improve earthquake catalogs to get a better understanding of earthquake physics. I use this new data to gain insights on earthquake nucleation, aftershock propagation and earthquake interactions in both interplate and intraplate regions.
I am also interested in "unusual" signals such as tremor and what they can reveal about "regular" earthquakes.

## Research Projects

2004 M6 Parkfield Earthquake, California, Earthquake Sequence

An Improved Earthquake Catalog for Iberia

Complex M5.1 Earthquake Rupture in Sparta, North Carolina
