## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/photo_square.jpg" alt="profile picture">}}

I am a PhD candidate of Geophysics at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I study Seismology.

I am working to improve existing earthquake catalogues by developing and implementing code that accurately and efficiently detects earthquakes in large volumes of seismic data. I use the improved catalogs to study earthquake physics, with particular attention to aftershock propagation, earthquake nucleation and earthquake interactions in both interplate and intraplate regions.

"Non-classic" seismic signals such as tremor, remote triggering and induced earthquakes and what they can reveal about "regular" earthquakes and the earthquake cycle are another research interest.
