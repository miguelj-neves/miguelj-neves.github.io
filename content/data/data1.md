## Overview

We present the high-resolution Parkfield matched filter relocated earthquake (PKD-MR) catalog for the 2004 Mw 6 Parkfield earthquake sequence in central California. A relocated catalog that spans from 6 November 2003 to 28 March 2005 and contains 13,914 earthquakes, about three times the number of events listed in the Northern California Seismic Network catalog.

Contains relocated earthquakes with calibrated magnitude estimates.
